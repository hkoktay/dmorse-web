        <p>This is a small example of a progressive web application made with <a
                href="https://angulardart.dev">AngularDart</a>. The application doesn't do much except for translating
            text into morse code. You can find the source code on <a href="">Github</a>. This is beta software, so
            don't expect a polished application.</p>
